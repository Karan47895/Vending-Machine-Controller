# Vending-Machine-Controller

Design implemented on Altera DE2 FPGA Board.
Modeling has been done in Verilog HDL using FSM architecture.
Users select desired product first, triggering prompt for required amount.
Input amount corresponds to product's price.
Controller verifies entered amount with product price.
If the amount is matched then the LED will glow on FPGA signifying the product is been dispensed.
